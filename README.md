To overcome fraudulent activities and land grabbing, we propose an idea of Blockchain based property/land registry system. 
The idea has the potential to transform Ecommerce sector, we will enable buying and selling of property assets online, and by using Blockchain technique we can overcome possibility of frauds and illegal approaches. 
The system will utilize IBM Hyperledger Fabric to maintain its ledger and will be accessible from web application. 
Once the asset will be posted on the system, all details will get endorse on Blockchain. 
The chaincode will further manage updating, deletion and transfer of the asset and store them in the system hyderledger. 
Government, corporate sectors, builders, and estate agents could benefit from our application.
